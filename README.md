# IdManager_API

## This is a basic API that manages a CRUD made in SQL Lite. The object of management is an Id, that basically consists of:

* Id
  * The item identifier.
* Title
  * The item title or name.
* Done
  * The item status, if it is done or not.
  * It's a bool value, so is true or false.
* Date
  * The item date of creation.
  * Currently gets the currently DateTime.

As I said, this API basically manages this interaction between the user requests and the controllers.
